In this jupyter notebook, I examined salaries in the NBA from 1990 until 2020. In particular, I was interested in measuring how salaries are distributed on teams, how this has changed over time, and how this correlates to win percentage. <!-- excerpt --> This jupyter notebook includes all the data scraping and transformation before the exploration of the data and justification of methods used.

For a high level overview, I recommend reading the "Introduction" and jumping ahead to "Spot Checking the Data" where the analysis starts.
