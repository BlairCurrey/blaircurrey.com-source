In the fall of 2018 I finished the first semester of my computer science degree. Armed with the facts of *Intro to Programming I* and knowing the basics of python I started on my first self-guided programming project â€” procedurally generated images of lakes using perlin noise. The project worked, but as you can probably guess, it wasn't pretty. <!-- excerpt --> The code that is. I was pleased with the lakes.

Two years later I have finished *Object-Oriented Programming*, *Data Structures and Algorithms I & II*, and revisted this project from a new vantage point. I will detail the original state of the program, my analysis, and the final, improved result. For more background information on the project and to see the improved state you can visit the [github repository here](https://github.com/BlairCurrey/lake-generator).
